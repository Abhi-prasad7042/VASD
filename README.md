# VASD (Vehicle Actuated Speed Detection)

VASD (Vehicle Actuated Speed Detection) is an advanced system designed for real-time vehicle detection and speed measurement using Jetson devices. This project utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for vehicle detection and classification, as well as PaddleOCR for extracting textual data. The integration with NVIDIA GPUs through DeepStream ensures efficient processing, enabling seamless operation even under demanding conditions.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Vehicle Detection:** VASD employs YOLO models to accurately detect and classify vehicles in real-time.
- **Precise Speed Measurement:** The system measures vehicle speed with high precision, ensuring reliable speed detection.
- **Optimized Performance:** Integration with DeepStream optimizes performance, particularly leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs for enhanced processing capabilities.
- **Zero Latency:** Through meticulous optimization of camera features, VASD achieves zero latency, enabling it to capture vehicles even at speeds of up to 200km/h.
- **Web Application Interface:** VASD includes a user-friendly web application interface for convenient site connection checking and verification of overspeeding vehicles, including the recognition of their number plates.

## Usage

The primary usage of VASD is for traffic management and surveillance purposes. By deploying VASD in critical areas such as highways, intersections, or urban roads, authorities can effectively monitor vehicle movement, detect speeding violations, and ensure road safety.

## Applications

- **Traffic Management:** VASD can be deployed by traffic authorities to monitor and manage traffic flow, detect congestion points, and identify traffic violations.
- **Law Enforcement:** Law enforcement agencies can use VASD to enforce speed limits, identify overspeeding vehicles, and issue tickets or warnings as necessary.
- **Safety Improvement:** By accurately detecting speeding vehicles, VASD contributes to improving road safety by deterring reckless driving behavior and reducing the risk of accidents.
